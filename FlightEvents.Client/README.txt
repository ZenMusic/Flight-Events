If you are running this for the first time, you might get a prompt to install .NET Core runtime.

You can click yes to get directed to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1
You can then download and isntall "Desktop Runtime 3.1.x" x86 (even on 64-bit OS).

The same installer can be downloaded directly at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.7-windows-x86-installer
